# 🛠️ CookieFarm Server Guide

Welcome to the documentation of the **CookieFarm server**!
This guide describes how to launch, configure, and use the server responsible for flag management.

---

## 🌐 Server Overview

The **CookieFarm server** performs the following tasks:

- Receives and stores flags submitted by clients into a database.
- Sends flags to the `flagchecker` and handles the results.
- Displays all flags via a web interface:
  - Whether they have been submitted.
  - Whether they have been accepted.

The server is written in **Go** and is designed for easy deployment in both development and production environments.

---

## 🚀 Running the Server

To run the server use docker with:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

## ⚙️ Execution Options

To configure the server, you need to create a `.env` file with the following parameters. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference to set up your configuration.

| Environment Variable | Description                                                          | Default      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `DEBUG`              | Enables debug mode when set to `true`                                | `false`      |
| `CONFIG_PATH`        | Path to a YAML config file (instead of using the web form)           | N/A          |
| `PASSWORD`    | Password to access the server web interface                          | `"password"` |
| `PORT`        | Sets the port the server will listen on                              | `8080`       |

The YAML config file as be like that:
```YAML
configured: true

server:
  host_flagchecker: "<ip_flagchecker>:<port_flagchecker>"
  team_token: "<your_team_token>"
  submit_flag_checker_time: 120
  max_flag_batch_size: 1000
  protocol: "cc_http"
  tick_time: 120
  start_time: <start_time>
  end_time: <end_time>
  flag_ttl: 5 # in ticks (if the ttl is 0, the flag will never expire)

client:
  services:
    - name: "CookieService"
      port: 8081
  format_ip_teams: "10.10.{}.1"
  regex_flag: "[A-Z0-9]{31}="
  range_ip_teams: 29
  my_team_id: 1
  nop_team: 0
  url_flag_ids: "<address_of_flagIds"   # Specific for CyberChallengAD
```


> [!WARNING]
> Security Risk: You are **strongly encouraged** to change the default password (`"password"`) to a strong, unique password. Using the default password poses a significant security risk as it could allow unauthorized access to your flag management system!

---

## 🌐 Web Interface

The **web interface** is accessible at:

```
http://<your_server_ip>:<port>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The actual web interface written in htmx and JavaScript is not updated so some features may not work as expected. The server is still functional, but the UI may not reflect all the latest changes. The new UI is being developed and will be available soon in the v2.0.0.

Through the UI you can:

- View all received flags.
- Check the submission and acceptance status of each flag.
- Configure the server (unless you setup the configuration from YAML file).

---

## 📂 Example Usage

### Setting up .env file

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
DEBUG=true
CONFIG_PATH=./config.yml
PASSWORD=SuperSecret
PORT=9090
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

This configuration runs the server:

- In debug mode.
- With password `SuperSecret`.
- On port `9090`.
- Using the configuration file `./config.yml`.

Happy flag cathing! 🎯
